HOW TO UPGRADE RN (from the RN docs)

In case you see issues after updating React Native from 0.63.x to 0.64.x (via rn upgrade), try this solution:

Create a new 0.64.x project, for example:

npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-typescript

Compare package.json of the new project and of your old 0.63.x project, and modify the old one.

Do similarly with ios/Podfile.

Run yarn install or npm install.

Run pod install in ios directory. Probably you need to remove the old Podfile.lock file.

Now, when you rebuild your project, hopefully the issue will be fixed.
