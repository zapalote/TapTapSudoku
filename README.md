# TapTapSudoku

One tap to pencil, two taps to lock-in the number.
Developed entirely with react-native.

We developed this app for the pure pleasure of a daily sudoku.
We found no other app that would offer this usability.
It's free of charge. No ads. We don't collect any data.
No rankings, no competitions. It's just you solving a game.
