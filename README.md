# TapTapSudoku

One tap to pencil, two taps to lock-in the number.
Developed entirely with react-native.

We developed this app for the pure pleasure of a daily sudoku.
We found no other app that would offer this usability.
It's free of charge. No ads. We don't collect any data.
No rankings, no competitions. It's just you solving a game.

## Prerequisites

Install node, react-native, react-native-cli

## dependencies

```
"react": "^16.0.0",
"react-native": "^0.50.0",
"react-native-i18n": "^2.0.9"
```

## build

Clone this repo. Then create an empty app with create-react-native-app. Copy all the source files to the empty skeleton. Then solve all dependencies. Sorry. I couldn't find an easier way.
